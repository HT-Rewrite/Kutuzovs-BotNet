**Disclaimer:** This repository is for educational and research purposes only. This is just a small project I made in the past and it got into the wrong hands... The author of this repository does not condone or support any illegal activities. Use this information responsibly and within the boundaries of the law.

For anyone asking yes, I was lazy to write my own disclaimer so I "skidded" armaniweb's disclaimer of his malware analysis.

Also, this is mainly spaghetti code since, it's an old project.
